During my college years, I was lucky enough to find/learn a lot of things on the internet for free.

Thanks to the contribution of youtubers, as well as other people who released their code or their notes I was able to overcome many obstacles that I had to face and finally overcome.

Now it's my turn to give back to the community that help I had when I needed it. This a short list, at the moment, of projects that I had collaborate and make me so glad to contribute to them realization:
