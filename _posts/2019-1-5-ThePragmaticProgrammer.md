Reading is another way to learn and grown as programmer.

Many blogs and website as Genbeta (in Spanish) have mention a book called: The Pragmatic Programmer. They considered it one of the classics programming books. Now, with no practical exercises to finish, no final exams and enough time. Now it's the perfect moment to read it and learn it.



As my old partner Iv√°n told me 2 years ago: Take the book and tell : "Teach me"
