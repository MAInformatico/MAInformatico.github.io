Advent of Code 2021 edition is coming. Based on the info available in Wikipedia: "Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar and can be solved using any programming language."
   
I take part on the two previous edition 2019 and 2020. This is an interesting and challenger experience that I am sure that a lot of coders will enjoy it. Just feel free to choose your favourite language and let's go!
   
The event will begin on December 1st. Each challenge contains two parts. They can be unlocked step by step. Once you finish an exercise you will get a string that you will need to check in proper web portal. If it is correct you will unlock the next part that usually requires to include/modify your current source code acording to the new requirements.
   
So if you want to test yourself and also have a fun time. Just go this link: [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/)
