esLibre 2020 is a Spanish event for Free Software enthusiasts. This year by the COVID-19 pandemy the event has been performed online using URJC infrastructure (Last year was in Universidad of Granada)
   
It has been my first time at this event and I really love it. All the meetings were really interested and it has been like a extra motivation to keep learning and searching the great growth of this community.

The sessions have been recorded so I expect that all the media will be available soon.
 
If you are interested on the different contents of esLibre 2020 there is the [link of the program (in Spanish)](https://eslib.re/2020/programa/)  
 
Until the media content will be available I update this post with the link.
