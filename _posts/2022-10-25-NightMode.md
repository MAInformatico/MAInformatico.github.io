As software developers we must take care of our health. It is strongly recommended to practice sport (You can find some recommended Youtube channels on this blog), a healthy diet, sleep over 7-8 hours each day etc. However beside these common recommendations, there is another one to consider, active night light in our OS. 

Night light is a feature available for Windows and Linux to adjust the screen of our screen during several hours. For example from 20:00 to 7:00 hours or from sunset time to sunrise time.  

The main difference between night light and "normal mode" if the light intense of our screen during these hours. Taking care of our eyes and allowing us to keep working or doing any other activity during more time.

We must to spend a lot of hours in front of our computers and laptop. So it is really necessary to evaluate this feature that some years ago it was not available made us feel exhausted in front of our computer.


If you wish to use it on Windows, please follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/76_08JuJ5IQ).  

I hope this info can be useful to you.
