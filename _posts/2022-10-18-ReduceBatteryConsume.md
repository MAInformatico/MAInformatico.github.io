title: Optimize your laptop battery
author: Migue

Battery consume has been one of the issue, if not the unique, during my student period at university. I got an exam of a subject called AI agent development that allow us to use our own laptop before a previous check by our lecture to ensure that you do not have internet access. 

However we did not have enough socket on the classroom. This means that you cannot charge the battery of your laptop. So if the battery is over, your laptop is shutdown.  

Several years ago, operative systems, hardware etc have been optimized so the consume can be adjusted to your needs. That's how I have found [tpl](https://linrunner.de/tlp/index.html) package for Linux.

This package allow us to adjust and optimize the consume of our battery adjusting our hardware, desactivating service we do not need right now (bluetooh, wifi etc). The difference before and after use this package is significant.
Before tpl: 1:40 hours
After tpl : 4:45 hours


The difference is really important it is a good tool for students and developers that needs to spend time for example in a plane or any other situation that you must work and you cannot connect your laptop.  

So, I hope that this info can be useful to you.
