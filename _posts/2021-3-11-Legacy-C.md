Visiting [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) I have found this [interesting link](https://github.com/mortdeus/legacy-cc)
   
It is one of the initial C compiler versions. In case of you do not know this language you can check this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
   
I think that this is an interesting repository because of its historical value.
