title: Communication, a critical soft skill
author: Migue
---

We talk a lot of algorithms, design patterns, news ... etc. However there is a critical soft skill that I would like to talk: Communication.

Books, e-mails, newspapers, smartphones ... all of those require communication. In our field, Software Engineering is critical to get clear what it required or needed, specially if we are talking about requirements or use cases.
  

I am not meaning that we must to write or speak like Cervantes or Shakespeare, that is not the idea. I mean that we must express ourself correctly. Using the syntax of the language we are using to express ourself (in this case, English).
  

For example, imagine that we are writing a paper. We can use one paragraph for each concept or idea we want to communicate. Just get express your idea/s, explain it/its properly using the syntax of the language (points, commas, paragraphs, adverbs etc). 
  


In short, write correctly and clearly this email or document (if you are writing something that other person could read) or speak correctly and clearly in case that you are talking with somebody.
  

By this way, you will avoid a lot misunderstandings and even lacks of information while you are sharing an idea or concept.
