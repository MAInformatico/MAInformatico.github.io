"We will our jobs because AI is better", "We will be fired" etc.

There is a lot of people worried about the AI. MCPs, MLs, Claude, John Doe ... Everybody talks about it. And many people thinks that this is the end of the days. I think that they have seen many movies and they are wrong. 
  

AI is a great change. That's all. I understand that we must learn to use it. But this does not means, for example that we do not need to study (we still need it) or developers will not program anymore (we will need it) and more simple, we have calculators and it does not means that we do not need to learn maths (If you are a kid, yes, you need to learn math and the other subjects).
  
We need to know AI and learn how to use it in our jobs. Many jobs will be updated or maybe removed and also many new jobs will be created.
  
This is a time of changes, we must learn to use the AI in our daily life. It does not matter if you like it or not. AI is here, you will need it for some tasks. Yes I mean some tasks.

  
AI is not a silver bullet, like Computer Sciences, Physics, Medicine, etc. it has its own scope, it can be useful to find a bug or learn somethind new. But it cannot replace your parents. So do not be scary, learn to use it and be ready for this new moment.
