Some months ago I read The Clean Coder from  Robert C. Martin aka "Uncle Bob". We can consider this book like an "ethical guide" for developers.
The book shows us several situation based on the author's experience that I consider really useful for developers on their early career and maybe for others more experienced.

The book is short and easy to read. You will find a lot of anecdotes used to introduce you the main concept of every chapter.
I think that this book needs to be in the "must to" list of every developer. Probably the book gets a lot of histories, however this resource is a good way to introduce every chapter that allows us to get clear inside the concept that the author wants to show us.
