It is mandatory updated your knowledge in Computer Sciences field. The quote: "Renovarse o morir" (Renew or die) is perhaps the best saying to sum up this idea.
   
One year ago, I found many posts and articles on the Internet mentioning something called: "CI". I read it several times, So, what is the famous "CI" that appears in these posts? What are these misterious file that are called: ".travis.yml" available in some many Github repos?
   
### CI a.k.a Continuous Integration
[Continuous integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) was created by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) in 2006. Based on this own words, Continuous Integration "is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day." 
   
After finished my degree, I found many companies used it on this business, we can deduce CI is widely used in the IT industry.
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/), Gitlab CI These sound familiar? Yes, These are CI tools. And you can test them for free! It is main that we have a powerful resource for us!
      
### So ... Let's go! Time to get Jenkins.
If you use Debian, this a good [link](https://tecadmin.net/install-jenkins-on-debian/) where it show how to install Jenkins on your local system. There is not the only way to use it, you can also get a [Docker container and execute Jenkins on it](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+with+Docker). 

### Do you have a github account? Get TravisCI
[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) make more easier our tests and deployments thanks to the integration with github. If you have an account just login on the TravisCI website, authorized the access and configure it to use it on your repos.

To use Travis you just need to create a .travis.yml file on the root of your repo and upload to your github repo.
