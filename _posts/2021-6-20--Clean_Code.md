Finally I have read Clean Code. Clean Code is considered as one of the classic in Software Engineering. It is true that part of the people disagree with the content of this books, because it is considered old, it is an opinion by the author etc.
   
Personally I think that this is a book useful to do an analysis of our own code and our habits. This is a book that uses Java as mainly and unique language. But I think that its lessons can be applied in other languages, always considering that not all the language are similar. This is a book that emphasizes in testing and meaningful variables names something that it is important to improve our code. 
   
In conclusion, I think that this is a book interested to read even if your opinion is completely different. As any other book, take the lessons you think are best for your professional growth.
