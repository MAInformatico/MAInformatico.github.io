MonthEnd is an app written in HTML5, CSS3 and AngularJS with the aim of help you to calculate your monthly fixed cost based in your salary.

It's so simple to use, just write your monthly net income and your monthly fixed costs (Rental bill, electricity bill etc)

In this way you'll obtain your monthly balance available for food, transport, sports etc.

The code is available under the Apache license. So feel free to check it out!

The app will receive more features soon. As you can see it's free software so any help or sugestion is more than welcome. 

I hope you find MonthEnd useful.
