[TelegramBot](https://github.com/MAInformatico/TelegramBot) is a project to help you to monitor your local network using Telegram API. To do that, TelegramBot reads files generated by [Raspberry-Pi-Monitoring-Network](https://github.com/MAInformatico/Raspberry-Pi-Monitoring-Network)
   
The bot allows you to know the hosts connected into your local network using the command: "/hosts" and the temperature: "/temperature". There are another "informals" features as: "/weather" that gives you a link to check the weather in Spain or "/hello" that will answer you "Hi, dude" :D
   
You will need to create your own bot using Fatherbot, see more info [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
   
The [project](https://github.com/MAInformatico/TelegramBot) is available on this [link](https://github.com/MAInformatico/TelegramBot) . As usual it is free software (GPL 3.0 - License) so feel free to execute it, read it, modify it etc ... I hope this project can be helpful to everybody
