Yesterday I release MonthEnd under Apache license.

So today I've add a new feature. "Export to pdf"

The feature "Export to pdf", as the name suggests, let you download your own results in a pdf file. The file contains the salary and the costs you've used including the city. So you can store in your devices all the data you want.

To do this new feature. I've use jQuery and jsPDF libraries. jQuery and jsPDF have MIT license (MIT and GPL too in the case of jQuery) that's mean that our Apache license can be used including the both license mentioned.


Meantime, the aplication is progressing :)
