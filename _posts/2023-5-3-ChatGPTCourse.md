OpenAI, ChatGPT's creators, has launched a [free course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) of its own tool. 

The course only requires a basic knowledge of Python. You can check the examples showed in the videos and perform your test using Jupyter integrated in the
proper platform. The course is short so you do not need many time to complete it.

Please do not forget that this course is free temporary!

We do not know how many time do we have to complete it. So, get ready and complete it as soon as possible.
