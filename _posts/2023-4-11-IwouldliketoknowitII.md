This is the second part of the last post related to your university period. These are my opinions based on my own experience while I was a undergraduate student.


* You could fail many tests.
    This is part of the learning process. All of us have failed many tests. On these moments you need to feel like Phoenix, get up, improve your strategy and pass the next test.
    These moments will make us stronger, resilient and these common adjectives, in other words: you are training yourself to be a professional, get ready to confront these situations and other in your life. We made the difference working when others quit and this is useful not only to study.


* People's opinion do not care

    If you study a technology degree (computer engineering, software engineering etc) it is probably that people made some commentaries related to this knowledge area. Commentaries like: "you are freak (or geek)", "this is really difficult", "Why are you studying this? (I received this last comment in a bank)" etc.
    Just do not care about these comments. I am sure that you have something better to do that listen to this guys. Just keep studying, spend time in your future and get the results of your effort!


* "Men sana in corpore sano"

    Street workout, running, cycling, swimming ... You can practice a lot of sports. I have written little list of sports you can practice in a park. Just need your sport wear, shoes or your bicycle. You can find some [Youtube channels](https://mainformatico.github.io/Sport_Time/) if you are interested on Street workout or workout at home.

    There is a lot of information in the network related to the benefits of sport in our physical and mental health. So just check it out and see all the benefits of this life style.
