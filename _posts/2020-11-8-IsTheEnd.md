Wake up, dude! Job is not done, even if you are a worker!
Technology never stops, today Javascript is one of the most populate languages on the world. AngularJS, ReactJS ... there are a lot of frameworks. How many other frameworks or languages can be developing right now while you are reading this post?

Ok, you got your degree and has a solid base of your field after several years. Now, you need to earn experience. The degree means that you have completed successfully the study plan of your university and has the base in a specific knowledge field. It is not mean that you are better than other persons, never forget it.

It means that I cannot relax and enjoy life? No, you need to do it too, this is mandatory to keep physical and mental healthy.
 
It means that you must to take care of your health and your career. I put healthy on first place because is more important than your career. You cannot do nothing without health, specially in the current times that we are suffering this pandemic.
 
Take care of your career, research, create, do wherever you want but keep learning and take responsability of yourself.
