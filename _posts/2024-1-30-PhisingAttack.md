Yesterday I received a phising email. The message tried to simulate an email from Microsoft, related to my Teams account, that was blocked after too many atempt to login.

The message included an blue button called "View my activity" DO NOT PRESS IT. I checked my account and it was true that was blocked.

However I did not use it for years, so that make me feel suspicious. At this point, I decided to change my password in the Microsoft site (please, always be sure that you are in the official website).

I did it, but my account kept blocked. Fortunately, I use my own account, so I can enter a code from my email (Microsoft give us this option). I use it, after received the email with the combination and voilÃ , my account was unlocked.

After this experience I really encourage you to use Second Factor Authentication (2FA). This must be an standard in all your accounts. Because it is one more layer to protect your access from pirates.
Only need to provide a cellular phone number.that will be associate to your account. Using
it, each login performed in your account will require to add a code that will be sent to your devices and you will must include or confirm on your device or your PC (this could be different).
