Finally I have read The Clean Coder. As Clean Code, The Clean Coder was written by the same author. 
   
This book could be read during undergraduated period. Its ethical focus, proffesionalism concept, pressure management etc must be mandatory to know for everybody during the first year at University.
   
This will let to know to the students how they would act in their proffesional careers and even with their partner during group practical exercises. This book will open your mind and let you to reconsiders many aspects of your job.
   
Ok, the book contains some personal situation from the author. This does not mean that I cannot be useful. Just read it, take the lesson that could help you and improve your knowledge and job wisely.
