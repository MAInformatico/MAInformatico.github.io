As song [Parasiempre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-XCNrtlSdE) said "There is nothing forever"
So I finish a professional period to begin a new one. Nobody knows where can appears a new oportunity. As I always say it is mandatory keep learning new languages, algorithms, design patterns ... without forget our personal life.

Life is impredictable so, take the oportunity, be ready and Let's go!!.
