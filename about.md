I'm Miguel Angel GutiÃ©rrez, software engineer focused on Python, APIs, and building scalable systems. In 2018 I began this blog. It contains posts about technology, computer sciences or other interested subjects as sport.

Apparently sport and technology do not have much to do with other. Nothing could be further from the truth, both areas complement each other.
  
The constancy and discipline of sport coupled with the problem solving of the programming creates three essential skills for work and personal life.

Enjoy your visit!
