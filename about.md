I'm Miguel Angel GutiÃ©rrez, software developer. In 2018 I began this blog. It contains posts about technology, computer sciences or other interested subjects as sport.

Apparently sport and technology do not have much to do with other. Nothing could be further from the truth, both areas complement each other.
  
The constancy of sport coupled with the problem solving of the programming creates two essential skills for work and personal life.

#### More Information

As well as my professional career I'm passionate of sport (as I mentioned), heavy metal, chess and reading.
